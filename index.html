            <p>I believe if you are happy then whatever you have done in your life makes sense and if you are not happy then it just means 
                you ended up making some mistakes on the way.

            <h2>Work is not meant to be pain,but joy</h2>
            <p>Finding a dream job might be the stressful process but it mostly is stressful because of how we look at it and
                think about it I believe that every field has its attractiveness and that's why I'm interested in many fields.
                I want to try myself in different places cause I think at any moment of our life we can find our passion in new things
