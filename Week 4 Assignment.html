                    Hello my name is Etuna I am 21 years old communication design student at NYC college of technology 
                    My passion through graphic design started when I was still a kid I used to draw a lot so 
                    finding a righ field for me was not really hard since I always knew what was making me happy
                    Being a student in New York in my dream field and also getting the first graphic design
                    internship is already a big win for me but it is also only beggining of the journey I am planning
                    to have.
            </p>

            <h2>What I Think about life</h2>
            <p>I believe if you are happy then whatever you have done in your life makes sense and 
               if you are not happy then it just means you ended up making some mistakes on the way.
            </p>

            <h2>What Is The Right Place For ME</h2>
            <p>My second important field is modeling and even though I am not planning to make a lifelong
                    career with it I believe the knowledge that I gained in fashion I would use as well.
                    I believe the right place for me as a graphiv designer is to become a creative director for
                    the brands I love.This really will be thhe dream come true to me.
